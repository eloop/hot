HOT
===

Houdini Ocean Toolkit

This version of the HOT is strictly for versions of Houdini >= 12.0.
For legacy versions go to the old repository on the Google Code site.

There is currently no support for building on Windows, I would welcome
the contribution of a compile.bat script that does the equivalent 
of compile.sh.

Compile and install with 

> ./compile.sh

Note that 

> ./compile.sh -f 

will rebuild and install without the time consuming compile of the 3rd party libs.

(Read the source of the compile.sh script for more build options.)

Test by loading the examples, start with SOP_Simple.hip.
